Steps to run the UI
-------------------------
1. Ensure you have Node.js and VueJs installed
2. Clone or download all the files from 2c2p-ui
3. Unzip the node_modules_part1.zip and node_modules_part2.zip and place all the unzipped files in /node_modules folder. These are the Vue library files needed to build and run the UI application. With these files, you don't need to run npm install

7. Then type the following command to build the UI, i.e. npm run build
8. Then type the following command to run the UI, i.e. npm run serve
9. Then UI page will appear.
10. Then ensure the 2c2p-api is running, then run the necessary functions/buttons
